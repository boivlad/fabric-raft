General:

    # Ledger Type: The ledger type to provide to the orderer.
    # Two non-production ledger types are provided for test purposes only:
    #  - ram: An in-memory ledger whose contents are lost on restart.
    #  - json: A simple file ledger that writes blocks to disk in JSON format.
    # Only one production ledger type is provided:
    #  - file: A production file-based ledger.
    LedgerType: file

    # Listen address: The IP on which to bind to listen.
    ListenAddress: 0.0.0.0

    # Listen port: The port on which to bind to listen.
    ListenPort: 7050

    # TLS: TLS settings for the GRPC server.
    TLS:
        Enabled: false
        # PrivateKey governs the file location of the private key of the TLS certificate.
        PrivateKey: tls/server.key

    Keepalive:
        # ServerMinInterval is the minimum permitted time between client pings.
        # If clients send pings more frequently, the server will
        # disconnect them.
        ServerMinInterval: 60s
        # ServerInterval is the time between pings to clients.
        ServerInterval: 7200s
        # ServerTimeout is the duration the server waits for a response from
        # a client before closing the connection.
        ServerTimeout: 20s
    # Cluster settings for ordering service nodes that communicate with other ordering service nodes
    # such as Raft based ordering service.
    Cluster:
        # SendBufferSize is the maximum number of messages in the egress buffer.

        # messages are waiting for space to be freed.
        SendBufferSize: 10

        # used to establish mutual TLS connections with other ordering service nodes.

        # ClientPrivateKey governs the file location of the private key of the client TLS certificate.
        ClientPrivateKey:
        # The below 4 properties should be either set together, or be unset together.
        # If they are set, then the orderer node uses a separate listener for intra-cluster
        # communication. If they are unset, then the general orderer listener is used.
        # This is useful if you want to use a different TLS server certificates on the
        # client-facing and the intra-cluster listeners.

        # ListenPort defines the port on which the cluster listens to connections.
        ListenPort: 7070
        # ListenAddress defines the IP on which to listen to intra-cluster communication.
        ListenAddress: 127.0.0.1

    # Genesis method: The method by which the genesis block for the orderer
    # system channel is specified. Available options are "provisional", "file":
    #  - provisional: Utilizes a genesis profile, specified by GenesisProfile,
    #                 to dynamically generate a new genesis block.
    #  - file: Uses the file provided by GenesisFile as the genesis block.
    GenesisMethod: provisional

    # block to use when initializing the orderer system channel and

    # descriptions of the available profiles. Ignored if GenesisMethod is set to
    # "file".
    GenesisProfile: SampleDevModeEtcdRaft

    # LocalMSPID is the identity to register the local MSP material with the MSP
    # manager. IMPORTANT: The local MSP ID of an orderer needs to match the MSP
    # ID of one of the organizations defined in the orderer system channel's
    # /Channel/Orderer configuration. The sample organization defined in the
    # sample configuration provided has an MSP ID of "SampleOrg".
